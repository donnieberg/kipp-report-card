###KIPP Character Strength Report Card

For my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program, I built a Character Strength Report Card prototype for KIPP Character Labs that allows students and teachers to complete assessments and see real time data analysis of their composite scores across semesters.

I'm continuing to build this out for Character Labs, and it'll officially launch in the new year!
